/**
 * Derive the raster icons from src/app/icon.svg.
 *
 * The SVG is the only icon committed. favicon.ico and apple-icon.png are built
 * from it here and are gitignored, because a checked-in binary beside the
 * drawing that produced it is a copy waiting to go stale — which is exactly
 * what happened in coffee's repo, and is why hours moved to this shape. A
 * derived file that cannot be committed cannot drift.
 *
 * These two stay raster because they cannot be anything else: /favicon.ico is
 * the ICO container format by definition, and Apple touch icons have only ever
 * accepted PNG. The icon browsers actually load is the SVG, and it stays
 * vector.
 *
 * Wired to predev and prebuild, so the outputs exist whenever the app is run or
 * built, on a fresh clone included. It only needs node and sharp — python is
 * for redrawing the SVG (`bun run icons:draw`), which is a design-time step,
 * not something a deploy should be made to depend on.
 *
 *     bun run icons        # this script alone, from the committed SVG
 *     bun run icons:draw   # redraw the SVG first, then this
